\section{Memory Tracking}

  Chombo provides a simply internal memory tracking facility.  

from \verb+memtrack.H+:
\begin{verbatim}
class Memtrack
{
public:
  static void ReportUnfreedMemory(ostream& os);

/// calls ReportUnfreedMemory with pout()
  static void UnfreedMemory();

  static void memTrackingOn();

  static void memtrackingOff();

  static void overallMemoryUsage(long long& currentTotal, 
                                 long long& peak);

};
\end{verbatim}

This is compiled into Chombo and turned on by default when 
the compiler macro \verb|ENABLE_MEMORY_TRACKING| is defined.

\verb+ReportUnfreedMemory+ produces a breakdown of current memory
usage broken down by Chombo class.  This does not include the system
image of the program itself, or stack usage.  This will also not
include memory allocated by the user, just memory allocated by
Chombo functions. RTTI is used in some places to identify the
type of objects held in a Chombo Vector template container.

example output of an \verb+UnfreedMemory()+ call:
\begin{verbatim}
Vector 3Box: 56 bytes (0 Mb)
Vector 5Entry: 252 bytes (0 Mb)
Vector Ui: 28 bytes (0 Mb)
Vector i: 16 bytes (0 Mb)
---------------------------------
Total Unfreed : 352 bytes (0 Mb)
peak memory usage: 360 bytes (0 Mb)
\end{verbatim}
