\bi
 \I This is a compilation error.  The user is trying to build the parallel version of Chombo
    but is not linking against an HDF5 build that has used {\tt --enable-parallel} when it 
    was {\tt configure}d
 \I Most Chombo users need access to both a serial and a parallel version of their HDF5 libraries.
    These are distinguished in the Chombo makefiles as {\tt HDFINCFLAGS} and {\tt HDFMPIINCFLAGS}
    (these values should be different).
