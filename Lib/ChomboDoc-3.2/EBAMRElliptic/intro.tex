\section{Introduction}

This document is to briefly explain the workings of the EBAMRElliptic
implementation.  First, the algorithm is explained.  Here we extend the
AMR multigrid algorithm of Martin and  Cartwright \cite{MARTCART} to
embedded boundaries using the results of Johansen and Colella
\cite{JohansenColella1998}, \cite{HANKTHESIS}.
Second, we document the implementation of the EBAMRElliptic software in
detail, trying wherever possible to draw the connections from the
software to the algorithm specification.  We shall describe the 
algorithm in both two and three dimensions.

We are going to present two examples.
For both, we are given a bounded domain $\Omega$ and a charge density distribution
$\rho$ which exists over all of $\Omega$ and we are given a
 boundary condition for the solution is given on $\partial \Omega$.
 We discretize the domain with a block-structured, adaptive mesh.

In the first example,
we solve Poisson's equation 
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot (\nabla \phi) = \rho
\label{FISHY}
\end{equation}
for $\phi$.  In the second example, we present
