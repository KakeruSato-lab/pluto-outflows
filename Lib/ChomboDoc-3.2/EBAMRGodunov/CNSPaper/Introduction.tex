\section{Introduction}

In this paper, we extend the unsplit embedded boundary method for hyperbolic 
conservation laws described in \cite{???}, allowing the addition of elliptic 
operators for advection-diffusion processes. We use these elliptic terms 
to represent the viscous and conductive terms in the compressible 
Navier-Stokes equations.

This paper is organized as follows. In \refSec{Equations} we discuss the 
compressible Navier-Stokes equations and relate them to their more general 
advection-diffusion conservation laws. In \refSec{Evolution} we outline an 
algorithm for treating the hyperbolic and elliptic terms, integrating them 
separately for stability. \refSec{DivF} describes the process by which the 
hyperbolic (transport) terms are treated in greater detail, whereas the 
elliptic (diffusion) terms are discussed in \refSec{Diffusion}. We explain 
some important details of the implementation in \refSec{Implementation}. In 
\refSec{Results}, we demonstrate the performance of the algorithm and its 
implementation on some interesting problems in gasdynamics.
